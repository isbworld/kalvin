This guide will help you use the Dog Breed Identification application to identify your dog's breed, learn about its characteristics, and access additional services.

## Getting Started

## Identifying Your Dog's Breed

### Step 1: Upload a Photo

1. Click the "Choose File" button or drag and drop a photo into the upload area
2. You can upload multiple photos, but the clearest one will be used for analysis
3. For best results:
   - Use a well-lit photo
   - Ensure the dog is the main subject
   - Choose a clear, front-facing image

### Step 2: Enter Pet Information

1. Enter your dog's name in the "Pet Name" field
2. (Optional) Check the "Use Image Preprocessing" option if:
   - The image has poor lighting
   - The background is cluttered
   - You want to improve identification accuracy

### Step 3: Start Analysis

1. Click the "Identify Breed" button
2. Wait while the system analyzes your photo
3. The analysis typically takes 10-15 seconds

## Understanding Results

Once the analysis is complete, you'll see the results page with several sections:

### Breed Matches

1. The system shows the top 3-5 breed matches with confidence percentages
2. Higher percentages indicate stronger matches
3. Mixed-breed dogs often show multiple breeds with moderate confidence levels

### Dog Attributes

The radar chart shows six key attributes calculated based on the breed matches:

1. **Size**: Physical size from small to large
2. **Weight**: Average weight in pounds/kg
3. **Aggression**: Tendency toward aggressive behavior
4. **Trainability**: Ease of training
5. **Energy Level**: Activity level and exercise needs
6. **Lifespan**: Average expected lifespan in years

### Attribute Interpretation

Each attribute is displayed with:

1. A numerical value (1-5 scale or specific units)
2. A short description
3. A visual representation in the radar chart

The attribute values are weighted averages based on the identified breeds and their confidence scores.
